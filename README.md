Hello, I am a current Computer Programming student and I mainly use this for my side projects/personal developments

I want to make my own game and make simulation but havent had the time to do so, so I am planning on doing so over the summer (aka now)

I mainly code in Python and JS but am planning on learning several more through this acount so keep your eyes out for some exciting stuff ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€ðŸ¦€
